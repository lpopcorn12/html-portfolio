        <p>Inland Potable Services is a potable water tank cleaning and inspecting services for most 
            major towns in the Western United States. I started my employment at this company around 
            January 2023. During my time at Inland Potable Services I have traveled around 19 states and 
            cleaned and inspected around 50 to 100 Potable Water tanks / towers.

        <p>With a crew of 3 divers, a truck, and a trailer full of dive equipment we would travel 
<img src="../assets/Images/Inland Potableprofile.jpg" alt="Diver being funny" class="potable">            around for 6 weeks at a time to different states and a whole lot of different cities. We 
            would get 2 weeks off and then back on the road for another 6 weeks. When on the road
            we would take turns being the diver that goes in the tanks and cleans them so every 3rd 
            day we would have to dive and most days we would be able to clean 2 tanks (if they were small).
        </p>
<br />
<br />        
        <p>In order to clean potable water tanks we would use compressed air to breath underwater
            for extended periods of time and we would have to use vulcanized rubber suits that 
            were dechlorinated before we got in every tank. After our equipment and us 
            were disinfected we would lower everything into the tank and a pump would 
            basically suck any debris that might have collected on the bottom of the tank
            over the years. Every day was a new tank, a new city, and sometimes a new state, but the 
            work ended up being more or less the same everyday. Im not saying it was a bad thing it just got repetitive after a while.

        <p>After around a year and a half of being on the road it got a little tiring and staying at 
            that many different hotels in a 6 week period got a bit to confusing at times, although 
            the money was really good I just decided after 8 years in the diving industry that the constant 
            traveling was getting to much so I decided to change carer's again and be an Electrician.
