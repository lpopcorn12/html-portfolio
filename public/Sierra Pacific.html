        <p>Dealing with covid and trying to work was a challenge, as i'm sure everyone remembers, but in May of 2020 I start working 
            at Sierra Pacific a lumber mill that primarily makes crown molding and door and window frames. My job was to sort the 
            cut wood into sizes for later processing. It was boring but the money was okay and it was a job. I ended up spending more time
            at Sierra Pacific than what I originally planed, but in Aug. 2022 I drove myself down to Florida to start diving again 
            at Underwater Mechanixs Inc.

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Aug. 2022 - Jan. 2023</h3>
        <p>Next I spent 5 months working in Pensacola, FL with Underwater Mechanixs or as we called it UMX.
            UMX did all kinds of diving in Florida and even went into the Gulf of Mexico on occasion although I spent 
            the majority of my time in Pensacola, FL and Mobile AL working on the pensacola bay bridge and also the 
            dock for a big oil and gas company. Working on the bridge was hard work but at the same time it was meaningful to me 
            and I learned a lot about pouring grout underwater which can be super difficult if your the guy in the water holding
            the hose and trying to get the grout to go where it needs to go. 
        </p>
        <p>December 2022 I had enough of Florida and decided to spend Christmas at home in California and in Jan. 2023 I started my final
            job in the diving industry with Inland Potable Services.
