  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am 31 years old, I currently live in California and I am starting my new career as an Electrician as well as my side hobby now as a web
      developer where I can learn and improve my coding and hopefully design and build my own websites.
    </p>
    <p>I have spent the last 8 years working as a Commercial Diver, which most people automatically think
      that all i ever do is weld underwater because they saw a few youtube videos of people doing it and to be honest that 
      is what drove me to become a commercial diver in the first place as well, but in fact i have probably only welded 
      twice in my 8 years in the field. Instead what i did the most of is Salvage, Burning, and Inspections. Over the years 
      I have traveled to and worked in 19 or so different states (some of those states were just some Potable Water
      Tank cleaning and inspecting jobs that usually only took a few days so I don't know if I would count some of them) and
      done some pretty amazing things along the way. I have spent two months in panama city beach Florida following hurricane Micheal
      salvaging a semi-complete fishing vessel that was suppose to set sail the following year. 
    </p>
    <p>I spent almost a year and a half salvaging and scraping around 10 derelict vessels in a section of the 
      Columbia River in Washington State that had been polluting the river for years
    </p>
    <p>My spring and summer of 2019 was spent in a small town about 10 miles from superman's own town(Metropolis, IL) called
      Olmsted IL where I helped deconstruct an old lock and dam and also help with the construction of the new lock and dam
      that was meant to replace the old one. I will say that spending around 3 hours a day(or night in my case since I was on
      the night shift) underwater with a torch that can melt steel was pretty awesome and I was getting paid well which was
      a major plus. 
    </p>
    <p>The last year and a half of my diving career I spent traveling to every state west of the Mississippi River and I would climb, 
      clean, and then inspect Potable water tanks(Mainly the drinking water for the cities that we traveled to). Some of the tanks
      would be 200' towers that you see driving on the freeway usually with the town name on it and those tanks we a pain to climb up.
